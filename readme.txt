We provide your audience a seamless way to purchase products directly from your site. It's the fastest way to earn money from your existing traffic.

== Description ==
ReadyShop is the easiest and fastest way to setup a free turn-key on-line store. ReadyShop is designed to integrate seamlessly with WordPress reducing the time it takes to start selling. We have made it so simple you’ll be up and running in a couple of clicks. Our drop in commerce solution gives your audience a means to support your creative efforts by allowing them to purchase products directly from your website instantly. We’ve created relationships with some of the best brands in the business so all you have to do is choose from our extensive list of products and they are automatically added to your store. It’s really that simple.

= Doing What You Love Full-Time =

ReadyShop was created with the content creator in mind. Can you imagine getting 10% commission on all gross sales from day one? That’s what other affiliate programs make you build up to. Your creative juices are the backbone of the Internet and our goal is to help you continue to do what you love and why we pay out a top-tier commission of 10% on all gross sales from the start to help you now instead of later. In this regard we don’t believe less is more, more is well, more.

= Stop Driving Your Traffic Away =

ReadyShop is the plugin that influencers and bloggers have been longing for because it is built with the blogger and influencer in mind. We appreciate your passion and understand how much time you put into creating great content to attract new readers and increase your SERP rankings. With this understanding we thought how can we help bloggers keep their traffic and not send it away as it is with most current affiliate programs. ReadyShop allows your audience to complete their purchase directly on your site. They never leave and with our inline blog tool you’re able drop clickable product links within anywhere on your site to help convert sales while you have their interest.


= No Cookies or minimum thresholds =

How many times have you worked with an affiliate program and had to fight for a commission because they said the lead came from another site, or perhaps you’re told the cookie has expired so don’t get commission on everything in customer’s cart. Have you been turned down by an affiliate program because your audience wasn’t large enough or you haven’t made the prerequisite number of sales in a specific timeframe? ReadyShop is a solution for all influencers no matter the size of your audience.

= Brands you know trust =

What products do you have and how do I know your brands will speak to my audience?  In short, we don’t.  However, our parent company is a very large production studio located in sunny Florida and has relationships with some of the biggest brands out there like:  Philips, KitchenAid, BergHOFF, Krupps, Nostalgia, Ninja, Oster, Cuisinart, Aspen, etc.  We currently have over 5,000 products to choose from and we continue to add new and exciting brands every month. You can easily find these products and brands quickly through our searchable database and add or remove products as easy as 1-click.

= Sell Your Own Branded Merchandise =

So you have a cool brand and want to sell your own merch?  No problem.  We can set you up the same way we setup our other vendor partners. If you have the ability to ship your own orders, then your branded shirts, hats, coffee mugs, cookbooks or anything else you sell can be added to your ReadyShop store. That in itself is pretty cool but what’s even cooler is now you become a brand and your products are available to all our other influencers as well. This means anyone who adds ReadyShop to their blog, can also add your products giving you and your band much more exposure.

= If it ain’t broke don’t fix it =

If you get paid to promote products and brands for a one-time fee or you are using ads and affiliate links, we think you should continue doing that if it’s working for you. ReadyShop does not conflict with any of your current methods of monetization but instead provides another avenue for revenue.
